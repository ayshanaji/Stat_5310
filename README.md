This Study conducts a detailed comparative analysis of Frequentist and Bayesian statistical methodologies applied to photon flux estimation, concentrating on scenarios with both single and variable photon counts (NASA, n.d.). Firstly, the investigation discerns negligible disparity between Frequentist and Bayesian methods in the context of single photon analysis, attesting to the solidity and dependability of both methods under stable photon count conditions. Secondly, in the examination of variable photon scenarios, traditional Frequentist methods display deficiencies, primarily when addressing the complexity of correlated parameters, thus underscoring the necessity for more nuanced techniques or assumptions to effectively manage the intricacies presented by variable photon data. Lastly, the Bayesian approach is shown to be particularly efficacious in scenarios with low photon counts (single photons), providing more precise estimations. The research evaluates this effectiveness via the implementation of various Bayesian priorsâ€”flat, informative, and Jeffreys' prior. The strategic selection and updating of these priors result in enhanced accuracy of estimations, thus highlighting the flexibility and proficiency of Bayesian methods in such specialized circumstances. This study contributes to the nuanced understanding of statistical applications in quantum mechanics and serves as a foundation for methodological advancements in photon flux estimation.
